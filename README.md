# What's this
It's a webserver which runs locally on your network using Flask to types text with typos and correction onto your computer.


# Why would I use this?

If your school has a annoying anticheat solution which invades privacy (**HONORLOCK! >:(**), but you're still a terrible student and need to make it look like you're typing out a essay that ChatGBT wrote, just simply write the promp on your phone, submit it to the host computer using the web server, and press the wake key to start *typing*! 

# MY CODE IS ASS
so please help me make this better :D

## Doccumentation is in the files, anything else, you're on your own.
